Cleaning up after yourself is important, and not just in real life. Good _Git Hygieneâ„¢_ goes a long way.

One of the methods I like to clean up is deleting unused feature branches. I do that both locally and on the remote source control server (github/gitlab etc).

As is common with Git there are many ways to feed a cat. Some people use this:

```bash
git push origin :name-of-branch
```

I prefer the more declerative way, especially for potentially destructive operations such as deleting a remote branch:

```bash
git push origin --delete name-of-branch
```

Either way, keeping your remote branches trim makes for a happier development team!
