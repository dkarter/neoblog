# This is h1 title

**h1** title is used up above at the start of the page. So you should start with h2 titles like this;

```md
## Your h2 title
```

Also using **h1** in the markdown content has no effect for the page. But for the accessibility and SEO reasons, use them in order. Order in this page is wrong, it is for demonstration purposes only!

## This is h2 title

### This is h3 title

#### This is h4 title

##### This is h5 title

###### This is h6 title above a divider

### And A Table

| Syntax    | Description | Another Column |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Header    | Title       | Another data   |
| Paragraph | Text        | Another data   |
| Link      | Text        | Another data   |
| Quote     | Text        | Another data   |
| Caption   | Text        | Another data   |

Table is styled as others in the file **Prose.astro**, look at the code block below. You can easily figure it out by changing the styles with prose-thead, prose-th, prose-td, prose-tr classes.

```html
<div
  class="prose prose-headings:text-neutral-200 prose-h2:mb-3 prose-h2:text-2xl prose-h3:mb-2 prose-h4:mb-1 prose-p:text-neutral-400 prose-a:scroll-m-20 prose-a:text-brand-600 prose-a:no-underline prose-a:transition-colors prose-a:duration-300 hover:prose-a:text-brand-500 prose-blockquote:border-l-2 prose-blockquote:border-l-brand-500 prose-blockquote:font-light prose-strong:text-neutral-300 prose-li:scroll-m-20 prose-headings:scroll-m-24 prose-li:marker:text-neutral-400 ..."

  ...
</div>
```

Oh, look an illusive footnote! => [^1]

[^1]: What you lookin at? Begone!.

## What about ordered lists? Numbered you ask?

Lists, within lists. Look at the indent!

1. **Data Analysis and Insights**

   - AI can process vast amounts of data quickly, providing businesses with valuable insights that inform strategic decisions.
   - Companies like Netflix and Amazon utilize AI algorithms to analyze viewer preferences and purchasing behavior, tailoring recommendations that increase user engagement and sales
     - I'm inside another list!
       - This can go on forever...
         - And ever...
           - and eve..

2. **Automation of Routine Tasks**

   - Many organizations are leveraging AI to automate repetitive tasks, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value work.
   - From chatbots handling customer inquiries to robotic process automation in finance, AI is streamlining operations across industries.

3. **Enhanced Customer Experience**
   - AI-driven tools, such as personalized marketing platforms and virtual assistants, enable businesses to provide tailored experiences to their customers.
   - A report by McKinsey indicates that companies implementing AI-driven personalization can see revenue increases of up to 10% or more.

## Or without numbers, unordered I mean?

While the benefits of AI are clear, organizations must navigate several challenges:

- **Data Privacy Concerns**: With increased data collection comes heightened scrutiny over privacy practices. Businesses must ensure they comply with regulations like GDPR to maintain consumer trust.
- **Job Displacement**: The rise of AI may lead to job displacement in certain sectors. Itâ€™s crucial for businesses to invest in reskilling their workforce to adapt to the changing landscape.

- **Ethical Considerations**: As AI systems become more autonomous, ethical considerations regarding their use and decision-making processes become paramount. Organizations must establish clear guidelines to govern AI applications.
