Ag (aka [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)) is an amazing piece of software. It allows you to define file types (like Ack) and comes prepackeged with some file types.

Using this feature you can list all files of a specific type in your project. For example say we want to list all Ruby and JavaScript files:

```bash
ag --ruby --js -l
```

Ag has the added benefit over Ack, that it ignores gitignored files, so you only get the files that matter (and not stuff from node_modules etc).

To see what filetypes Ag supports:

```bash
ag --list-file-types
```

The list is pretty extensive! Unlike Ack however, there is currently no way to add new file types or extend the list.
