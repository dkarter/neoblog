If you need to use a different SSH key for a git command such as `git push` you can do so by setting the `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` environment variable like so:

```bash
GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -i ~/.ssh/custom_key" git push
```

This can become a lot easier to use if you define that env var automatically when entering a directory by using [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv).
