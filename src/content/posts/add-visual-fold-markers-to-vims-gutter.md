TIL that you can display visual fold markers in Vim's gutter by setting the `foldcolumn`!

```vim
set foldcolumn=2
```

The number indicates how wide the gutter holding the fold marks should be.

Here it is in action:

This also makes the folds openable via mouse, which may be useful for some folks.

For more info: `:h foldcolumn`
