Whenever I forget the syntax for a certain SQL command in Posgres I usually reach for [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) or simply search DuckDuckGo for the the specific command. That usually yields the Postgres official documentation website which is great...

Wouldn't it be nice though if I could stay right inside psql and get the documentation I am looking for?

It would.. and it's possible:

```
\h create index
```

Use `\h` followed by the SQL command - this is not the full verbose documentation that you would find on the Postgres docs website but it's more of a syntax reference - which is most of the time what you need.

If you are not sure what to type or simply want to explore new commands try typing `\h` without anything after it - you will see something like this:
